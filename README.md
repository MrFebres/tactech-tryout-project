# tactech-tryout-project
A fullstack project for tactect tryouts, using reactjs, nodejs, express and mongodb.

first of all you've got to execute 'npm i' from the folder to get all the require dependecies installed for the correct functioning of node.js, express and mongodb.
After that you have to do the same, but this time from the client folder, to get all the dependices require by ReactJS and the front-end part of the project.

To get it in a full functioning, follow this steps:
1.- Run/start mongodb with the command line 'mongod' on your terminal or shell.
2.- run/start nodejs with the command line 'node server.js', it will show you on terminal that got started and correctly connected to the database.
3.- Run with the command line on your client folder 'npm start', it will start running your front-end with react.

Then you are good to go to check out the web app.
